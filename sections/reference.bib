abstract = {Owing to the corrosive, flammable, and explosive properties of pipeline materials in alkylation units, corrosion failure may result in leakage, fire, and explosion accidents. A bursting accident occurred in the 90° elbow of an alkylation unit pipeline. Failure analysis was performed by macroscopic analysis, metallographic analysis, chemical composition, corrosion form analysis, and corrosion product analysis. Finite element software was used to analyse the flow velocity, turbulence intensity, pressure, and wall stress distribution. The fault tree was combined with the analytic hierarchy process to realise the transformation of the structural importance-judgement factor-judgement matrix and to weight the events that may cause device corrosion failure. The results showed that uniform corrosion and stress corrosion of hydrofluoric acid occur in the pipeline and uniform corrosion is the dominant effect. Hydrofluoric acid corrosion leads to severe thinning of the pipe wall, making its strength drop below the bearing strength and rupture occurs. Quality of internal anticorrosion coating, water content of the medium and working temperature are the key factors to prevent pipeline leakage in alkylation unit.}

abstract = {An intelligent support system is needed to assist in the identification of abnormalities of a human heart. The integration of signal processing with machine learning techniques is a new research trend in the studies of heart sound analysis. This paper proposes a heart sound feature dimension reduction and classification methods using supervised machine learning algorithms, by utilising the first (S1) and the second (S2) heart sounds, produced due to vibrations during the closure of heart valves. The features of S1 and S2 heart sounds are extracted in both time and frequency domains. Time domain features are based on S1 and S2 sound distance, amplitude, sound peak area, sound peak cycle duration and intensity, whilst 20 Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) filter-bank energy for 12 coefficients represent the frequency domain features. Statistical values of the selected features are further used to increase the number of heart sound features. Due to the size of the extracted features, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) dimensionality reduction technique has been used to select the best features for normal and abnormal heart sound classification using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. It has been shown that the proposed LDA/ANN heart sound classification model achieved 90%, 83.33%, and 93.33% classification accuracies using the time domain, frequency domain and combined time-frequency domain features, respectively. The results using the proposed method are significantly better than previous classification methods by other researchers, with minimal complexity. This work provides a step forward in providing clinical informatics tool to assist clinician in providing early detections of abnormal heart conditions.}

abstract = {With ever increasing global demand and depleting resources for fossil fuels, oil and gas industry is now positively looking for advanced robotic solutions to increase their productivity and safety. With time easy resources of the fossil fuels are shrinking and newly searched reservoirs, to feed supply demands of global consumption, are mostly located in extreme environmental conditions such as hot deserts, deep water and arctic zone etc. Production of the fossil fuels, in such inhospitable environmental conditions, poses difficult challenges to health, safety and environment (HSE). Tragic incidents like Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills are examples of such challenges. Therefore, oil and gas industry has lot to learn from successful implementation of robotics and automation for dull, dirty and dangerous (3D) tasks of manufacturing industry. Most of the robotics technologies, currently used in the oil and gas industry, are mainly focused on inspection, maintenance and repair (IMR) of plant facilities with higher frequency and accuracy. Fundamental idea, involved in the automatization of these processes, is based on the principle of teleoperation with skilled operator. Automation of 3D tasks not only improves HSE standards but also lead to much needed economic efficiency by reducing production cycle, floor space and number of staff members required for continuous inspection and manipulation of plant facilities. Considering the risks involved in this industry usage of completely autonomous robots, first without achieving very high reliability, is still a far fetch choice. Therefore, semi-autonomous robots, where actions are performed by robots but cognitive decisions are still taken by skilled operator, is an excellent choice for this industry as a near future solution. In the onshore oil and gas industry robotic solutions are used both in upstream and downstream processes, such as site survey, drilling, production and transportation, mainly focused in the form of in-pipe inspection robots (IPIRs), tank inspection robots (TIRs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) etc. This paper presents the state of art robotic solutions currently used in onshore oil and gas facilities.}
