abstract = {Owing to the corrosive, flammable, and explosive properties of pipeline materials in alkylation units, corrosion failure may result in leakage, fire, and explosion accidents. A bursting accident occurred in the 90Â° elbow of an alkylation unit pipeline. Failure analysis was performed by macroscopic analysis, metallographic analysis, chemical composition, corrosion form analysis, and corrosion product analysis. Finite element software was used to analyse the flow velocity, turbulence intensity, pressure, and wall stress distribution. The fault tree was combined with the analytic hierarchy process to realise the transformation of the structural importance-judgement factor-judgement matrix and to weight the events that may cause device corrosion failure. The results showed that uniform corrosion and stress corrosion of hydrofluoric acid occur in the pipeline and uniform corrosion is the dominant effect. Hydrofluoric acid corrosion leads to severe thinning of the pipe wall, making its strength drop below the bearing strength and rupture occurs. Quality of internal anticorrosion coating, water content of the medium and working temperature are the key factors to prevent pipeline leakage in alkylation unit.}

abstract = {Vibration-based rolling element bearing diagnostics is a very well-developed field, yet researchers continue to develop new diagnostic algorithms quite frequently. Over the last decade, data from the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Center has become a standard reference used to test these algorithms, yet without any recognised benchmark it is difficult to properly assess the performance of any proposed diagnostic methods. There is, then, a clear need to examine the data thoroughly and to categorise it appropriately, and this paper intends to fulfil that objective. To do so, three established diagnostic techniques are applied to the entire CWRU data set, and the diagnostic outcomes are provided and discussed in detail. Recommendations are given as to how the data might best be used, and also on how any future benchmark data should be generated. Though intended primarily as a benchmark to aid in testing new diagnostic algorithms, it is also hoped that much of the discussion will have broader applicability to other bearing diagnostics cases.}
